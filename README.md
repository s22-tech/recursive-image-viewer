# Recursive Image Viewer
A PHP script that recurses into directories and displays all the images within as a HTML page with links to the image file.

Recursively scans a directory and returns an array of the images within.

This can be used as a stand alone application for viewing images or, if you are a web developer, you can put this in the root of your site and easily have a way to search all the images on your site from one page.

Adding the GET param "all" allows recursion to display all images from subdirectories.
