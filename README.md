# recursive-image-viewer
A PHP script that recurses into directories and displays all the images within as a HTML page with links to the image file.

Recursively scans a directory and returns an array of the images within

This can be used as a stand alone application for viewing images or if you are a web developer you can put this in the root of your site and easily have a way to search all the images on your site from one page.

Adding the GET param "all" allows recursion to display all images form subdirectories
